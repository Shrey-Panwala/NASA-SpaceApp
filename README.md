# NASA-SpaceApp
This project forecasts air quality by integrating NASAâ€™s satellite data (NO2, O3, PM2.5) from Earth Data with ground-based data from OpenAQ using API keys. AWS S3 is used for storing and processing data. The system provides real-time insights to help monitor and predict air pollution levels effectively.
